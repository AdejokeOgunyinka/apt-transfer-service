# apt-transfer-service

This project was a journey from a state of complete ignorance when it comes to Java & Springboot, 
to a state of knowing the basics.
I didn't do as well as I could because everything about Java and Spring boot is totally new to me.
Nonetheless, this was a really fun and nerve-wracking challenge.

I started out trying to Dockerize the API so that it can be accessible from any device, but I didn't 
achieve that goal. And the rest of the time was spent on figuring out the API.
I spent more than a day going through the materials, with the aim of understanding things. 
I also didn't have enough time to adequately test the API. 

I wasn't even able to work in branches. I committed my work directly to the main branch here on Github.
